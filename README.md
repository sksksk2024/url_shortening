## My process

### What I learned

**The key takeaways I will gain from completing this project:**

- Gaining a deeper understanding of `fetch`, which I'm still getting familiar with.
- Improving my knowledge of `background` styling in pure CSS.
- Enhancing my skills in styling and **positioning**, which still takes me the most time.
- Becoming more accustomed to **developing logic independently**, focusing on structure, error handling, fetching, and other key aspects.

### Continued development

I want to focus now in learning testing, using vite/vitest from now on, and expirement with web-vitals. And after making some projects with an instructor, I will dive into more frontend mentor projects and practise what I learned!
